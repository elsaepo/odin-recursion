# Recursion
A simple 2 assignment project, cositing of a fibonacci generator and a merge sort function

Part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion).

Created by Carl Madsen, 2022.

## Functionality

* **Fibonacci** - Assignment 1 - creates an array of the fibonacci sequence with a given length. Contains iterative and recursive solutions.
* **Merge Sort** - Assignment 2 - sorts an array using recursive merge sort methodology

## Learning outcomes & challenges

* **Recursive methodology** is the core of these projects. I had used it a bit rpeviously, but implementing it into creating a merge sort function was a great learning exercise
* Learning more about **time and space complexity** was very interesting - something I had touched on in the past and wondered about but to really see it in action (especially with the prescribed learning material) put it all together.
